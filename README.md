## Key Implementation Details

### TypeScript Integration

The project uses TypeScript with Vue.js class-based components for enhanced type safety and better developer experience:

- **Interface Definitions**: Custom `Todo` interface for type-safe data handling
- **Class Components**: Leveraging `vue-class-component` for cleaner component syntax
- **Type Annotations**: Full type coverage for props, methods, and computed properties

### Component Architecture

- **App.vue**: Main application component managing todo state and operations
- **Todos.vue**: Reusable todo component with full CRUD functionality
- **Event Handling**: Clean parent-child communication using Vue.js events

### State Management

- **Reactive Data**: Vue.js reactive system for automatic UI updates
- **Local State**: Component-level state management without external dependencies
- **Data Flow**: Unidirectional data flow from parent to child components

## Design Features

- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes
- **Modern UI**: Clean, minimalist design with smooth animations
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support
- **Visual Feedback**: Hover effects and transitions for better user experience

## Performance Optimizations

- **Lazy Loading**: Components loaded only when needed
- **Efficient Rendering**: Vue.js virtual DOM for optimal performance
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Lightweight build with essential packages only

## Browser Support

- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Local storage persistence
- [ ] Dark/light theme toggle
- [ ] Drag and drop reordering
